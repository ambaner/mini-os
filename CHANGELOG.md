## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Partition table support** — MBR scans all 4 partition entries and prints type, LBA, size, active status
- **Volume Boot Record (VBR)** — `src/boot/vbr.asm`, chain-loaded from the active partition
- **Disk image tool** — `tools/create-disk.ps1` stamps partition table into MBR and writes VBR at partition LBA
- **LBA extended read** — MBR uses `INT 13h AH=42h` (DAP) for LBA-based disk reads

### Changed
- Build pipeline now: assemble MBR + VBR → create partitioned raw image → wrap as VHD
- CI workflow verifies VBR signature and partition table presence
- Release zip now includes `vbr.bin` alongside `mbr.bin`

### Added

- **Build system** — `build.bat` / `tools/build.ps1` with automatic NASM download
- **Hyper-V VM setup** — `setup-vm.bat` / `tools/setup-vm.ps1` creates or updates a Gen 1 VM
- **Design document** — `doc/DESIGN.md` covering architecture, VHD format, toolchain, and roadmap
